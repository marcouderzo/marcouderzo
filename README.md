### Hey! 👋

😄  Hi, I'm Marco. Let me introduce myself:

- 📚 I'm a Computer Science student @ UniPD, interested in Machine Learning & Data Science applied to Molecular Biology and to the Biomedical field. I'm also keen on learning about what's behind 3D Graphics, CGI and VFX, and I enjoy getting my hands dirty with fun and useful electronic projects using Arduino boards and microcontrollers.
- 🎓 I graduated high school at Liceo Classico G.B. Brocchi (Bassano del Grappa), so I have a background in Art History, Philosophy, Latin and Greek Languages & Literature.
- 🎨 I'm also a self-taught Traditional & 2D/3D Digital Artist in my free time. Tools I use:
    - Traditional Side: Paper & Pencil Colours.
    - Digital Side: Photoshop (Drawing/Painting for 2D works, Compositing for 3D ones), ZBrush, Substance Painter, Keyshot.
- 🎹 I enjoy playing the Piano when I find one around. If I discover a catchy song on Spotify, I'll get the music sheet and learn it.
- 🏋️ I pick heavy things up and put them down. That is to say, I enjoy working out and Powerlifting.
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I am Albert Uderzo's second cousin, the artist behind the Asterix Comics.
